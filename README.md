<h2>Welcome to my MITxPRO Capstone Project: Banking App:</h2>h2>
<br></br>
<img src="keystoneBank.png"></>
<br></br>
<p>This app is built with MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).  The UI provides a create account form for user name, email, and password.  Once signed in the user can deposit, withdraw, and check balance.  The user info is saved across sign in sessions within the Mongo database.  Routes to handle HTTP requests are in the index.js and dal.js files.</p>

<h2>To Run App</h2>
<br></br>
<li>Fork this repository to your local directory.</li>
<li>Visit "https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation" for instructions on installing MongoDB on your local machine</li>
<li>Open the directory in your Terminal and $npm install</li>
<li>Once complete, enter $node index.js</li>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<br></br>

<p>Future iterations should include user email, password, and google authorization through a service such as Firebase, administrative designation to limit user access to other user data, as is available in the 'AllData' page.  As well, further file organization to deliniate frontend from backend functionality and seperate docker containes for each, as well as one for the database.</p>
