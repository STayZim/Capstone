Welcome to my MITxPRO Capstone Project: Banking App

This app is built with MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).  The UI provides a create account form for user name, email, and password.  Once signed in the user can deposit, withdraw, and check balance.  The user info is saved across sign in sessions within the Mongo database.  Routes to handle HTTP requests are in the index.js and dal.js files.

Future Improvements

Future iterations should include user email, password, and google authorization through a service such as Firebase, administrative designation to limit user access to other user data, as is available in the 'AllData' page.  As well, further file organization to deliniate frontend from backend functionality and seperate docker containes for each, as well as one for the database.
